/// Performs envelope estimation for a signal.
///
/// The level detector performs leaky integration of the input signal to
/// estimate the envelope. Therefore, for a signal `x(t)`, the level
/// `l(t) = alpha*l(t-1) + (1-alpha)*x(t)`.
///
/// When creating a new level detector, a tau is specified, rather than an
/// alpha. Tau is the time constant, which corresponds to how quickly the
/// envelope estimate reaches steady state.
///
/// The integration uses two different values of tau, depending on whether the
/// signal is greater or less than the current envelope. This means the attack
/// value can be set very low to respond quickly to bursts in signal power,
/// while the release value can be high in order to coast through periodic
/// troughs in the signal.
